<!--Movie app for tracking movies Sha and I watch-->
<!--Need to haves: 
*Cards to contain the movies and contain the following: 
-Movie Title
-Plot summary
-Our rating
-Rotten Tomatoes rating if possible

*IMDb or similiar API to pull movie info
*Cards need a GET and Post function (axios)
*Cards should have a pop up into a modal when expanded. 
*Card data should be stored somehow, MySQL, MongoDB or JSON
*Probably done in Vanilla JS, JQuery, and HTML, eventuall push to React/React Native for phone use
*Needs media queries for Mobile use
*Date and sort function for Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring movie lists-->
